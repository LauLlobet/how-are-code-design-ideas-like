## Code design concepts

## Code design is how readable is code 

Readable code is faster to reason about. It is also more matainable and allows faster onboarding and entrustment of tasks.

Regardless of the technical implications code is (as written language) subdivided, it is modularized into packages.

Kinds of packages (modules):
ğŸ“¦ - Class/File
ğŸ“¦ - Function
ğŸ“¦ - Package/Folder
ğŸ“¦ - Service/Project
ğŸ“¦ - Line of code
ğŸ“¦ - ...

This packages communicate to each other, they may hide some information to their outside users (data), they can also hide some implementation details (logic).
